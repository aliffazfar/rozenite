'@rozenite/network-activity-plugin': prerelease
---

This change addresses an issue where network responses with malformed or complex Content-Type headers (e.g., "application/json,text/plain,_/_" or "application/json; charset=utf-8") were not correctly identified as JSON. Previously, the system relied on an exact match for "application/json", leading to these responses being incorrectly displayed as binary content.

By updating the content type checks to use `.startsWith('application/json')` and similar for other types, the plugin can now correctly parse and display JSON content. This change improves the debugging experience for real-world applications that may send non-standard Content-Type headers, bringing the behavior in line with other robust network logging tools like Chrome's network inspector.
