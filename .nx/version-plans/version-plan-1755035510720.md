Rewrites the cookie parser to properly handle React Native specific header logic and adds support for displaying multiple header values when they are arrays. The cookie parser now correctly parses Set-Cookie headers according to React Native's networking behavior, while the Headers tab can now display multiple values for headers that contain array data, improving the debugging experience for network requests with complex header structures.
